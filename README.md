> SmartThings Edge Device Drivers are the new method for integrating Hub Connected Devices into the SmartThings Platform. With the launch of SmartThings Edge, we are taking some events that would have happened in the Cloud and moving them to the SmartThings Hub. SmartThings Edge uses Lua-based device drivers and our Rules API to control and automate devices connected directly to a SmartThings Hub. This includes Zigbee, Z-Wave, and LAN devices as well as automations triggered by timers and other Hub Connected devices using drivers. In the future, this will expand to include more protocols and features, like the new Matter standard.
